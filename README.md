## Getting started

### Backend

1. Update [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go/) dependency to the latest minor version:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. Build backend plugin binaries for Linux, Windows and Darwin:

   ```bash
   mage -v
   ```

3. List all available Mage targets for additional commands:

   ```bash
   mage -l
   ```
### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   yarn run test

   # Exits after running all the tests
   yarn run test:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   yarn run server:configured
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Playwright and @grafana/plugin-e2e)

   ```bash
   # Spins up a Grafana docker instance (v11.0.0) (port 3000) with an actual Prometheus instance (port 9090)
   yarn run server:configured

   # Starts the e2e tests
   yarn run e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   yarn run lint

   # or

   yarn run lint:fix
   ```
