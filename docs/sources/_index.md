## Migrate from core Prometheus to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

If you are using core Prometheus with SigV4 authentication, you must migrate to the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus data source because SigV4 auth is deprecated in core Prometheus. This topic summarizes the steps required to migrate from core Prometheus to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. See a detailed list of steps [here](src/README.md).

- Get the `UID` for Prometheus using SigV4.
- Get the `UID` for your new Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.
- Update dashboards with the new datasource `UID`.
- Update alert rules by exporting provisioning files and updating the data source in the model or create new alert rules.
- Recreate correlations.
- Recreate recorded queries.

### Authentication

Depending on the environment in which it is run, Grafana supports different authentication providers such as keys, a credentials file, or using the "Default" provider from AWS which supports using service-based IAM roles. These providers can be manually enabled/disabled with the `allowed_auth_providers` field in Grafana's config file. To read more about supported authentication providers refer to [the AWS authentication section](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/aws-cloudwatch/aws-authentication/#select-an-authentication-method)
